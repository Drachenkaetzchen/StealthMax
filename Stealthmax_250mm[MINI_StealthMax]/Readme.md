Hey! Welcome to **tiny Stealthmax**!

Lets decrease size a bit shall we, in order to print the Stealthmax on machines with a 250mm bed? At about 20% smaller than a regular Stealthmax, lots of changes have been done.

**Note:** This is a shrunken stealthmax and should as of yet only be considered an early beta. It has not been thoroughly test printed or assembled (although mounting pieces have been tested and shown to work, and other parts like lid and latch pieces retain the same size, and thus are known to work from the regular release).

- The 65mm GPU Fan has been swapped for a [**60mm Delta KFB0612HAFDB**](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/delta-electronics/KFB0612HAFDB/9974259). It has less air flow at 9.15cfm unrestricted, but on the other hand is much less noisy. The unrestrictive nature of a stealthmax circular basket also allows for much more usable airflow from this fan compared to a smaller filter design.
- The panel has shrunken to **200mm @ 3mm** thickness.
- Mounting points for VOC sensors has changed compared to the regular stealthmax.
- **Hepa filters** have been changed to smaller [**Xiaomi Mijia 1C circular HEPA filters**](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EwnZuLl), which means the total carbon depth (equaling efficiency) of the filter has not decreased more than a bit over one centimeter compared to the original Stealthmax.
- Most everything else remains the same from the regular BOM, including sensors, pico, buck converter, with just a few minor bolt changes: Exact fastener list as per the CAD file available above is (feel free to use the affiliate links from the main stealth max page for any purchases!):
