* Don't have a Voron back panel cutout?
* Want to be able to install a Stealthmax on any surface?
* Don't want to order custom laser cut panels and be able to mod the panels easily DIY style?

Try these modded files. They replace the files with the same numbers from the regular STL directory. 

Whats needed to mod your panel (3mm recommended, 2-4mm will work without modding the screw pieces)?
- A 40mm hole saw drill (and a drill)
- A 3mm drill bit (and a drill). A 2mm one to pre-drill for the hole saw can help but not an absolute prerequisite.

  The new 2-Flow chamber comes with print-in-place drill-aims! You can not miss! You dont need to be able to measure with sub-mm precision. Just put the Flow Chamber on the surface, tape it down where it should be, and point and drill eight (8) 3mm holes. Five holes where the 40mm cutouts will be. And the three holes aroun the center 40mm exhaust cutout going all the way through the Flow Chamber.
  Once you have 8 holes in the exact right spots, put on the 40mm hole saw and drill the five (5) 40mm holes through the panel that will serve as air intakes/exhaust as well as mounting screws.

  Note - compared to the regular BOM, this variant adds a heat insert on the back side below the center exhaust, and requires an additional m3x10 (or 12, but then the main chamber side corresponding bolts needs to be 10mm instead of 12). The two 25mm m3 bolts that usually mounts the stealthmax to an extrusion will likely be a tad short (only 2mm will extend through a 3mm panel, on to which 28mm bolts would be perfect.
