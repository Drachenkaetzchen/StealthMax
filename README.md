# StealthMax
a non-warp Nevermore Max Frame. Smaller, less parts/assembly, easier sourcing. Uses standard bolts, easily available GPU fan, and adds an optional exhaust option. The HEPA filter has moved into the center hub in order to shrink the overall size (now uses Xiaomi Mijia G1 130x40mm hepa filters).
