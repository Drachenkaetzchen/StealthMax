# StealthMax
a non-warp Nevermore Max Frame. Smaller, less parts/assembly, easier sourcing. Uses standard bolts, easily available GPU fan, and adds an optional exhaust option. The HEPA filter has moved into the center hub in order to shrink the overall size (now uses Xiaomi Mijia G1 130x40mm hepa filters).

BOM coming soon. STLs exported. Check out the first version software bluetooth controller with klipper integration @ https://github.com/SanaaHamel/nevermore-controller.

Special thanks to @SanaaHamel @TubaToothpasties @Blamm @Backslash for all the help, nudges, support and additions to the project!
